# PythonAIAgentFromScratch

A lightweight research agent built from scratch in Python.  
This project demonstrates how to glue together a simple AI “agent” that can load tools, read environment settings, and perform research-style tasks (document retrieval, QA, etc.).

## Features

- **Modular tools** (`tools.py`) for data fetching, processing, or custom actions  
- **Configurable** via environment variables (`.env`)  
- **Pluggable**—add new tool modules or extend existing ones  
- **Scripted entry point** (`main.py`) to drive agent workflows  

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- pip (or another package manager)  
- (Optional) A virtual environment tool such as `venv` or `conda`
